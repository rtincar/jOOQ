Version 2.0.1 - December 23, 2011
=================================================================

This is a maintenance release for jOOQ 2.0. The main improvements
include

- Better integration for using jOOQ with Spring Data. This
  includes support for named parameters, as well as allowing to
  change bind values on previously constructed Query objects
- The MERGE statement has been enhanced for better integration
  with Oracle.
- jOOQ is now ready to use with Scala / Groovy

For more information about using jOOQ with Scala, see this blog
post:
http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/12/11/the-ultimate-sql-dsl-jooq-in-scala/

There is now also experimental support for a custom type mapping.
This mapping allows to rewrite data types at code generation time
as well as to specify custom enum data types (e.g. boolean Y/N).
Not all integration tests run smoothly for custom data types,
hence, this feature is not yet fully supported.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#691  - Add support for Oracle CURSOR REF IN / INOUT parameters
#677  - Add type-mapping configuration, enforcing types for
        columns
#947  - Add custom type mapping support (experimental)
#968  - Allow for custom enum types, configured in the code
        generator (experimental)
#974  - Add Schema.getTable(String), getSequence(String),
        getUDT(String) for better runtime Schema meta-navigation
#975  - Add Sequence.getName(), getSchema(), getDataType()
#980  - Add support for named parameters, to better interact with
        Spring
#991  - Add Query.bind(String, Object) and bind(int, Object) to
        easily modify existing bind values
#992  - Document thrown DataTypeException in Convert methods
#998  - Enhance MERGE statement for Oracle extensions: 
        WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE .. WHERE .. DELETE WHERE ..
        WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT .. WHERE .. 
#1000 - Add support for MySQL's INSERT INTO .. SET .. syntax in
        MERGE statement's WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT clause

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#981  - Cannot insertInto(table("my_table")), as plain SQL tables
        return Table<Record>, not Table<TableRecord>. Relax
        bound on R
#988  - Change Factory.field(String) to return Field<Object>
        instead of Field<?>
#999  - Make MERGE's WHEN MATCHED .. and WHEN NOT MATCHED ..
        clauses optional
#1001 - Identity.getField() should return TableField<R, T>
        instead of Field<T>
#1006 - Add Factory.value(...) as a synonym for Factory.val(...)
        for increased Scala / Groovy compatibility

Bug fixes
---------
#973  - EnumType renders name() instead of getLiteral() in
        formatXXX() methods
#977  - EnumType renders name() instead of getLiteral() in
        Convert.convert() method
#979  - Record.from() sets all changed flags to true. That's not
        necessarily correct in the event of storing the record
        back to the DB
#985  - AbstractRecord.equals() does not correctly compare
        arrays. Compare them using Arrays.asList()
#986  - Postgres / DB2 / Sybase ASE foreign-key namespace is
        unique-per-table. jOOQ forces all foreign keys from all
        tables into the same namespace
#990  - Problems when encoding arbitrary byte[] as String(byte[])
        in inlined SQL. This can cause issues when DEBUG-level
        logging is activated
#995  - Routines don't respect SchemaMapping - Github issue #8
#1002 - TableRecord.storeUsing() doesn't update IDENTITY column
        values, if the column is not part of the main unique key
#1003 - Sybase / SQL Server / MySQL / Ingres / H2 / Derby's
        INSERT .. RETURNING simulation returns null if a table
        has an IDENTITY column, but no primary/unique key
#1005 - The INSERT INTO .. VALUES .. syntax may cause type-safety
        issues in some databases. VALUES should be converted
        before binding

Test cases
----------
#984  - Detach IDENTITY column tests from UNIQUE KEY tests,
        create a dedicated test suite instead

Version 2.0.0 - November 25, 2011
=================================================================
This release is a fresh start in many areas of jOOQ, adressing
issues that have been requested by users for a long time. These 
release notes docment the most important changes, a detailed
upgrade guide, as well as the detailed list of improvements.

Most important changes
----------------------
- The API became more static. This applies to many Factory
  methods, such as val(), literal(), as well as to many Field
  methods that have been moved over to the Factory. For example,
  when before, you wrote this using "postfix function notation":
  
    <pre>NAME.replace(" ", "_").trim()</pre>
    
  you will now write (just as in SQL):
  
    <pre>trim(replace(NAME, " ", "_"))</pre>
    
  Using static imports of Factory.*, jOOQ makes SQL look even 
  more like SQL. The current "postfix notation" is maintained for
  backwards compatibility.
- By default, jooq-codegen will now generate a "dynamic" meta 
  model as opposed to the existing static one. Generated tables
  covariantly override the as(String) aliasing method, leading
  to a much more convenient aliasing style. When before, you
  wrote:
  
<pre>
Table<TRecord> parent = T.as("parent");
Table<TRecord> child  = T.as("child");
Condition join = 
  parent.getField("ID").equal(child.getField("PARENT_ID"))
</pre>

  You can now write:
  
<pre>
T parent = T.as("parent");
T child  = T.as("child");
Condition join = parent.ID.equal(child.PARENT_ID)
</pre>

  Of course, the existing notation still works

- Exceptions are no longer checked. When previously, the DB's
  SQLException was propagated to client code, there is now an
  unchecked DataAccessException hierarchy, similar to that of
  Spring. This will eventually give way to a standardised error
  handling abstraction, in future developments.
- Window functions are now constructed from their underlying
  aggregate functions just like in SQL. For example:
  
<pre>
sum(AMOUNT)
sum(AMOUNT).over().partitionBy(ACCOUNT)
</pre>
    
  This makes for a more concise API, especially when considering
  future extensions, such as Oracle's KEEP (DENSE_RANK FIRST...)
  syntax.
- More type safety has been introduced regarding various places
  where generic <R extends Record> and <T> types are involved.
  This is especially true for INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE statements 
- Sequences now also have a <T> type
- Unsigned number types are now supported in those databases that
  use them. Unsigned numbers are implemented in jOOU, a spin-off
  open source project. For convenience, this library is
  "internalised" into jOOQ, to avoid adding a dependency
  
http://code.google.com/p/joou/

Upgrade instructions:
---------------------
Various of the above changes are incompatible with jOOQ 1.x. In
order to upgrade, please be aware of the following pitfalls:

- The schema needs to be re-generated.
- Much of the post-fix function notation is replaced by static 
  methods in the Factory. Today's org.jooq.Field API is 
  maintained in jOOQ 2.0, for backwards compatibility. It will
  be removed, eventually, though. Expect some incompatible
  changes, where window functions are involved
- Some Factory instance methods (such as val(), literal()) are
  now static. They are compatible, but may cause compiler
  warnings.
- The meta model is now an instance model by default. If you 
  prefer the static meta model, you can configure this in your 
  jooq-codegen configuration.
- The additional typesafety involving <R> and <T> types may cause
  compiler warnings and errors.
- SQLException is no longer part of the API. This can cause
  compiler issues, in particular when extending jOOQ
- Some utility classes have moved to org.jooq.tools

Should these incompatibilities be too significant for your
project, you can still stay on the 1.x branch, which will be
maintained for a while. Be aware that upgrading might be more
difficult, later, though.

Version 1.6.9 - November 7, 2011
=================================================================
This is a maintenance release for the 1.x branch. Developments
on this branch will stop after version 1.6.9. Only important bug
fixes are merged to this branch. Developments for release 2.0
have started.

The most important functionality in release 1.6.9 is the newly
added support for JDBC batch operations. You can now batch 
execute several queries.

See the official blog for more information:
http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/10/25/jdbc-batch-operations-with-jooq/

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#621 - Add support for JDBC batch operations
#794 - Add support for ORDER BY [int value] in order to reference
       a column index for sorting
#882 - Optimise Field.isTrue() and isFalse(). Take Field's data
       type into consideration.
#885 - Add support for INSERT INTO .. VALUES (..) syntax, 
       omitting explicit field declarations
#887 - Add <E> List<E> Cursor.fetchInto(Class<E>)

Bug fixes
---------
#748 - H2 regression in 1.3.158 regarding stored functions, which
       return a ResultSet (this was fixed in H2)
#859 - Derby casting of numeric types to BOOLEAN doesn't work
#886 - Regression in date extract function when used in a 
       subselect
#888 - Derby casting of VARCHAR to FLOAT (and similar) doesn't
       work

Version 1.6.8 - October 22, 2011
=================================================================
The main improvement of this release is the re-design of the
stored procedure / function API. With 12 supported RDBMS, which
all have their own idea about what is a stored procedure and what
is a stored function, it has proven to be a better design, to
unite them in one single type: org.jooq.Routine. A routine can
have a return value as well as OUT parameters. It can be embedded
in SQL and used as a field or a table.

This means, you will need to re-generate your database schema,
when upgrading to jOOQ 1.6.8. After re-generation, you'll need to
fix your client code. These are the package changes:

- [generated.package].procedures > [generated.package].routines
- [generated.package].functions  > [generated.package].routines
- [generated.package].Procedures > [generated.package].Routines
- [generated.package].Functions  > [generated.package].Routines

Oracle generated packages are not re-located. With these
improvements, using stored procedures and functions becomes even
more reliable, especially when cursor types are involved. Read
more about the rationale behind this change:

http://lukaseder.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/what-are-procedures-and-functions-after-all/

Apart from that, important improvements have been made in the
area of plain SQL tables. Also, consider a demo integration of
jOOQ with Google Cloud SQL:

#861 - Field.replace(String) generates bad SQL for various RDBMS.
       Field.replace(String, String) works, though
#863 - Ingres integration generates illegal SQL when selecting
       things like SELECT 1 WHERE 1 = 1
#866 - Sybase ASE Field.replace(String) function incorrectly
       removes the argument string

       to speed up integration tests

Version 1.6.7 - September 25, 2011
=================================================================

This release coincides with the launch of the new website at
http://www.jooq.org. Hence, it ships with little additions to the
deliverable itself.

Apart from new convenience methods, the main addition is a Maven
plugin for jooq-codegen contributed by Sander Plas.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#797 - Create Maven plugin for source code generation
#825 - Add List<Result<Record>> Factory.fetchMany(String) to
       allow for fetching several result sets from stored 
       procedures, such as Sybase ASE's "sp_help"
#838 - Implement MetaDataFieldProvider.toString()
#841 - Add <T> List<T> Result.getValues(Field<?>, Class<T>)
#842 - Add Query.getBindValues() method to allow for extracting
       bind values in the correct order
#843 - Add Factory.fetch(ResultSet) to transform a JDBC ResultSet
       into a jOOQ Result

API changes (backwards-compatible)
----------------------------------
#837 - Avoid final keyword on Object methods, such as .equals(),
       .hashCode(), etc

Bug fixes
---------
#836 - Bad syntax when selecting from aliased plain SQL tables
#839 - Boolean conversion in getValueAsBoolean() should trim 
       String values first
#840 - Numeric conversions in getValueAsXXX() should trim String
       values first
#844 - NullPointerException when selecting a column from a Result,
       that does not exist

Version 1.6.6 - September 11, 2011
=================================================================

Finally, support for another RDBMS has been added. Sybase's other
important product Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise (or simply
Sybase ASE) is now officially supported by jOOQ

Apart from this, there had been important improvements with the
recently added INSERT .. RETURNING clause, as well as some fixes
related to DECIMAL / NUMERIC data types

       RETURNING clause. This now works for DB2, HSQLDB, MySQL, 
       and Postgres
#827 - Support Sybase SQL Anywhere's TOP n START AT m clause
       instead of simulating it with nested SELECT's
       
API changes (previous API now deprecated)
-----------------------------------------
#817 - Deprecate Factory.lastID(Identity)

Bug fixes
---------
#815 - SQL Server fetching of IDENTITY value is broken
#821 - Optimise ResultQuery.fetchAny() executing fetchLazy()
       internally, and only fetching one record from the cursor
#822 - Let Constant cast to more precise NUMERIC/DECIMAL types
       in those RDBMS where casting is necessary
#823 - Cannot bind SQLite BigDecimal, BigInteger types - bind

#828 - Document inefficient implementation for GREATEST and LEAST
       in some RDBMS

Version 1.6.5 - August 28, 2011
=================================================================

This release finally adds a loader for CSV data to jOOQ. You can
now load CSV data using a simple fluent API, configuring error
handling, duplicate behaviour and transaction handling, as well
as various CSV parameters.

This release also changes the way generated keys are retrieved
after INSERT's. Instead of (potentially inconsistently) running
SELECT MAX(pk) immediately after the INSERT, Postgres' INSERT..
RETURNING clause is used (or simulated), in a single statement.

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#784 - Add Result.exportXML() to retrieve a DOM document similar
       to that of .formatXML()
#792 - Add support for loading of CSV data into tables
#795 - Add <T> List<T> fetch(int, Class<T>) and 
       fetch(String, Class<T>) convenience methods
#803 - Add support for INSERT .. RETURNING or simulate it where
       not available
#805 - Add <T> T[] fetchArray(int, Class<T>) and 
       fetchArray(String, Class<T>) convenience methods
#806 - Add <T> T fetchOne(int, Class<T>) and 
       fetchOne(String, Class<T>) convenience methods

Bug fixes
---------
#798 - Oracle IN (...) clause with more than 1000 arguments does
       not work
#802 - Use "INSERT .. RETURNING" instead of "SELECT MAX(pk)"
       to retrieve the primary key of a new record

Version 1.6.4 - August 07, 2011
=================================================================

This release ships with a couple of useful concepts inspired by
other frameworks. These are:

- selecting into custom POJO's. Results can be mapped to POJO's
  by convention or using JPA @Column annotations
- selecting into custom callbacks. This is already a wide-spread
  practice in Spring JdbcTemplates.
- selecting long-running queries asynchronously. This idea has
  been inspired by the Avaje Ebean framework

Apart from these changes and some bugfixes, the internal API has
been completely re-designed. The idea here is that query
rendering and variable binding are even faster (less String
objects), more extensible and more accurate. This is a pre-
requisite for many future developments with even more complex SQL
statements, such as for instance CTE's (Common Table Expressions)

Features and improvements
-------------------------
#137 - Add support for asynchronous query execution using
       FutureResult<R> ResultQuery.fetchLater() similar to 
       Avaje Ebean
#198 - Add SELECT INTO functionality into POJO's using 
       <T> T ResultQuery.fetchInto(Class<T>) similar to JPA
       CriteriaQuery
#728 - Add .fetchInto(RecordHandler<R>) to ResultQuery, Result,
       and Cursor to allow for callbacks similar to Spring's
       JdbcTemplate/Ollin Framework
#774 - Add more TRACE logging to .fetchLazy()
#777 - CURSOR: Add function alias: UNNEST for TABLE
#781 - Add E function (Euler number)
#782 - Add <T> T Record.getValue(..., Class<? extends T>) methods
       for convenient type conversion
#785 - Allow for storing TableRecord with a provided Field<?>[]
       indicating the primary key
#786 - Document thread-safety facts in Factory Javadoc
#788 - Add Key.getFieldsArray() convenience method
#793 - Add support for Oracle's SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH function

API changes (backwards-incompatible)
------------------------------------
#758 - Change internal QueryPart rendering and binding API to use
       Configuration and Context as callback parameters. If you
       use CustomField or CustomCondition, please correct your
       implementations accordingly. Other parts of the API should
       not be affected
#778 - Purge deprecated API, deprecation prior to jOOQ 1.5.7
#790 - Purge deprecated generated code, deprecation prior to
       jOOQ 1.5.7

API changes (previous API now deprecated)
-----------------------------------------

#789 - Deprecate Record constructors with Configuration
       parameter

       (several tables in FROM clause)

Bug fixes
---------

#759 - Omit the TOP 100 PERCENT clause in SQL Server ordered
       top-level queries
#767 - An empty Java package is generated for PL/SQL packages 
       containing underscores
#771 - Some exotic literals are not properly escaped with quotes
       yet, e.g. UDT identifiers, VARRAY types, etc.
#775 - Automatic re-attaching after deserialisation does not work
       when used with .fetchLazy()
#787 - The UpdatableRecord's internal changed flags are not
       updated after INSERTs / UPDATEs

Version 1.6.3 - July 31, 2011
=================================================================

This is mainly a maintenance release with lots of bugfixes,
mostly around code generation, plain SQL tables, and data types.

changes due to #639 (see below for details)! 

Apart from that, project CURSOR is advancing and it is now
possible to unnest arrays into tables. See this article for

       values
#755 - NullPointerException when converting an array containing
       a null value

Version 1.6.2 - July 10, 2011
=================================================================

This release mainly introduces three new projects.

Project CURSOR where jOOQ finally supports various RDBMS's TABLE,
CURSOR, and REF CURSOR data types. This is especially useful when
those types are returned from stored procedures and functions. 
Cursors are simply mapped to jOOQ Result<Record> types and can 
thus be used like regular table results

Project EXPORT aims at exporting data from the database in 
various serialisable formats, such as XML, CSV, HTML, Text, JSON.
This project will be continued in the future, to also 
deserialise from (some of) these data streams. This will allow 
for easy transport of jOOQ Result<?> types over the net.

Project CODEGEN has finally been started. Many improvements 
suggested by jOOQ users will be implemented in the next releases.
In this release, important fixes have been made to prevent 
compilation errors in generated artefacts.

Version 1.6.1 - June 19, 2011
=================================================================

In this release, the PORTABILITY project has been implemented.
Finally, the SQLDialect has been removed from most generated
artefacts (Schema, Table, Field, Sequence, etc). Also, the
constructing Factory is not referenced by its created QueryParts
anymore, unless this is really necessary (Query objects, UDT's, 
ARRAY types). This leads to higher compatibility between schemata
of different databases, e.g. if users want to use an HSQLDB 
development and Oracle productive database.

Unfortunately, this means that the way stored procedures are
called had to be changed. This is an API break that could not be
avoided. The pre-1.6.1 StoredObject.execute(Connection) method
is deprecated and will be removed in the future. It has been
replaced by StoredObject.execute(Configuration)

In addition to this project, many more window functions are now
supported, as well as the Oracle-specific CONNECT BY clause for
recursive queries.

#634 - Sequences are not escaped in generated SQL

Version 1.6.0 - June 05, 2011
=================================================================

Apart from supporting various additional standard and non-
standard JOIN constructs, there is now also full support for the
SQL standard MERGE statement and MySQL's ON DUPLICATE KEY variant

=================================================================

This version ships with lots of new functionality. Finally, the
DSL-style API has been extended to CRUD operations (INSERT, 
UPDATE, DELETE)! Also, support for the TRUNCATE TABLE statement
has been added.

The most important new features include the support for SQL:2003
standard window functions, which are available in most major

Version 1.5.8 - April 29, 2011
=================================================================

Finally, jOOQ now supports two important new RDBMS:
SQL Server and Sybase!

Apart from this great enhancement, there is now also full support
for the non-SQL standard LIMIT clause, even in dialects where the
LIMIT clause is not supported natively (especially Oracle, but
also DB2, SQL Server and Sybase, which have limitations). jOOQ
simulates LIMITs by rendering nested selects filtering on ROWNUM
(Oracle) or on ROW_NUMBER() (DB2, SQL Server and Sybase).

Other interesting additions are an increasing support for native
mathematical functions. More function support will be added in
future versions.

Features
--------
#16  - Added support for SQL Server
#21  - Uniform implementation of the LIMIT clause. Implemented
       LIMIT clause simulation through analytic functions, where
       LIMIT is not supported natively

#418 - Measure time of various steps in source code generation
#420 - Added support for proprietary SQL extensions "FOR UPDATE"
       and "FOR SHARE"

       implementations in the jooq-meta artefact
#436 - Added support for the modulo function
#438 - Added floor and ceil functions
#439 - Added support for mathematical functions (logarithms,
       exponentials, sqrt)
#447 - Enhanced Field.add() and Field.subtract() to work for date
       time fields, also


API changes
-----------
#428 - Created new Maven artefact jooq-meta to cleanly separate
       database meta-data navigation from code generation
#458 - Decreased DSL verbosity for arithmetic operations and for
       ordering

Bug fixes
---------
#417 - Restored warning when unknown column type is encountered

Version 1.5.7 - April 17, 2011
=================================================================

This is the first release built with support of Maven thanks to
the help of some jOOQ users!

The main new features in this release are the improved support
for serialisation/deserialisation of jOOQ objects through use of
the newly introduced "Attachable" interface.

If using log4j or the newly supported slf4j logging framework
in debug/trace mode, there is the possibility to log query
building/execution time statistics.

Apart from these new features, fixes were mainly done in the
fields of type casting, HSQLDB 2.1 upgrade support, stored
procedures with OUT, IN/OUT parameters. Please upgrade, if you
are using any of those features.

If you extend jOOQ as a base implementation for source code
generation, be aware of the fact, that the jOOQ-codegen is
currently undergoing major changes. Expect the code generation
API to stabilise again in one of the next releases.

Version 1.5.6 - March 31, 2011
=================================================================

This release consists mainly of code generation bug fixes and
minor API improvements and enhancements.

The most important improvement is ticket #90, by which lazy
fetching and iteration over data is now supported. jOOQ lets you
keep a reference to a Cursor that has an open JDBC ResultSet, to
fetch data from on-the-fly.

A few major code generation bugs were reported where the
generated code may cause ambiguity due to an inconsistent API.
This means that you will have to re-generate your schema after
upgrading to version 1.5.6. Some of your code may not compile
anymore, after this upgrade.

Features
--------
#90  - Added possibility for lazy fetching of data
#208 - Added convenience methods for direct invocation of
       sequences' currval() and nextval() attributes
#212 - Created one factory per dialect for better separation of
       dialect-specific support
#213 - Generate a factory for each schema
#251 - Opened up base implementations for Field<?> and Condition
       to allow for custom implementations by client code
#274 - Integrate H2 ARRAY types with stored procedures
#292 - Documented usage of log4j and java.util.logging
#306 - Added support for the NULLIF function
#319 - Added Field.between(Field<T>, Field<T>) method 
#320 - Added trace logging for variable binding and SQL
       generation methods

In version 1.5.5, there was a fatal bug breaking Derby source
code generation. Only the Derby dialect is affected. Please
update immediately, if you are using jOOQ's Derby integration

Bugfixes
--------
#315 - Generated master data records are not sorted by PK
#316 - Derby code generation fatally broken

Version 1.5.5 - March 12, 2011

This version is released early as there are some important
bugfixes. Additional improvemetns include:

- Improved DSL related to conditions in HAVING and JOIN clauses
- Support for Oracle-style functions, such as NVL, NVL2, COALESCE
  DECODE, etc

Features
--------
#304 - Add support for Oracle NVL function
#305 - Add support for COALESCE function
#308 - Add support for Oracle NVL2 function

Version 1.5.4 - March 04, 2011
=================================================================

Feature #243 required a minor API change in the base classes of
generated source code. This means you have to re-generate all
your jOOQ artifacts in order to migrate to 1.5.4. The artifacts
themselves should be regenerated in a compatible way, such that
your client code should not be affected. If this is not the case,
please report a ticket here:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jooq/newticket

Apart from the Derby RDMBS and some new data type support, there
have been many new convenience methods added all over the API.
For instance, if type-safety is not really a requirement, there
are lots of possibilities to use plain SQL directly in the DSL.
In that case, data can be accessed from Record, Results, not only
through Field<?>, but also through field names or indexes.

Check out the updated documentation (soon) here:

  https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/jooq/wiki/Examples

- Support for the Derby RDBMS
- Support for casting. This allows for even greater flexibility
  in cases where jOOQ cannot 100% ensure type-safety
- Support for ARRAY types. Oracle, Postgres, HSQLDB and H2 ARRAY
  types are now supported natively as regular <T> bindings in
  jOOQ's Field<T>
- Support for dialect-specific data types. CHAR, VARCHAR, CLOB
  are no longer treated equally as java.lang.String. Their
  type heritage is also generated
- More sequence support
- Lots and lots of bug fixes
